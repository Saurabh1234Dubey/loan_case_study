# loan_case_study of data analysis:


Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refusesto pay or runs away with the money owed.  

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

These are the steps we are following to data analysis

Step 1: Data Cleaning

    In this section, we have removed unwanted data which were not useful in our analysis

    We have removed unique and null data from data set. 

    Included those columns which are useful for Univariate Analysis & Bivariate Analysis

Step 2: Univariate Analysis

    Plotted univariate graph based on charge off and paid off sorted by Highest, Higher, Medium, Lower, Lowest.


Step 3: Bivariate Analysis

    Plotted bivariate graph based on different-different column as per our requirement.
    Made function to plot based on Highest, Higher, Medium, Lower, Lowest.
